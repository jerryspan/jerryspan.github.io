Currently, I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (DACS)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-advanced-computing-sciences) and at [Maastricht Law+Tech Lab](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/law-tech-lab) (Faculty of Law), at [Maastricht University (UM)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) in the Netherlands. My current work/research lies in the area of Social Computing and includes computational social media modeling, dialogue systems (conversational agents) and information retrieval, topic detection and tracking from text data and pattern discovery from multimodal data sources. More specifically, I am interested into using Large Language Models (like chatGPT) in a controlled way and build useful applications that have added value for all relevant stakeholders.
