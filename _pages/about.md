My name is Gerasimos (or Jerry) Spanakis. You can find a guide to ny name [here](https://jerryspan.github.io/name). Currently, I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (DACS)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-advanced-computing-sciences) and at [Maastricht Law+Tech Lab](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/law-tech-lab) (Faculty of Law), at [Maastricht University (UM)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) in the Netherlands. My current work/research lies at the intersection of Social Computing, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Law, combining fundamental research on Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), robustness and bias with applied work on socially relevant domains such as legal AI systems, social media transparency and language-centric technologies. My work advances both the scientific understanding of AI systems and their responsible deployment in social, legal and regulatory contexts, building bridges between technical innovation and societal impact.
