🎉 3 papers accepted @ COLING 2025! More info below

---

Just before the holiday break🎄❄️ and I am delighted to share that some of our latest NLP work is making waves 🌊 since we got 3(!) papers accepted at the 31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2025 https://lnkd.in/dR8bgtXu)! Some info on the exceptional work of these A-🌟-M-💫-A-✨-Z-🔥-I-🎉-N-🌈-G-👏 PhD candidates below 👇👇👇

1/ The ultimate PhD paper of Antoine Louis asks "whether to fuse or not to fuse" in an (legal) IR scenario 🔍. BM25 is still a performance beast 💪 in IR, but it's crucial to know when it shines ✨ and where it falls short ⚠️ compared to dense models. In the paper we explore different scenarios and conclude:
● BM25 = still the 🐎 of search, esp. in zero-shot tasks or when efficiency rules.
● Fusing models? 🤝 Great for zero-shot—boosts general IR models
● Got domain-specific data? 🧠 Fine-tune one model forbest results.

2/ Have you noticed how most information retrieval work is in English and Chinese? Well, Antoine and Vageesh noticed the same and as a PhD-side-project worked on delivering ColBERT-XM 🌍 a modular retriever for 81+ languages 🧩 Built w/XMOD encoders & ColBERT’s backbone, it trains on English (high-resource language) and transfers zero-shot to other languages, thereby eliminating the need for language-specific labeled retrieval data.💡✨

3/ Paweł Mąka's 2nd PhD paper dives into: how do context-aware machine translation models really use context? 🤔 We analyzed attention heads and found:
🔑 Some are critical for pronoun disambiguation.
🚀 Fine-tuning these heads = boosted performance!
This work builds on VOXReality EU project, where we -efficiently- integrate SoTA MT models in AR/VR 🕶️🌐🎮 scenarios, therefore context use is essential.
