	abstract     = {Authorship Attribution (AA) approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are important in various domains, including forensic analysis and cybercrime. However, they pose Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications/Aspects (ELSI/ELSA) challenges that remain underexplored. Inspired by foundational AI ethics guidelines and frameworks, this research introduces a comprehensive framework of responsible guidelines that focuses on AA tasks in NLP, which are tailored to different stakeholders and development phases. These guidelines are structured around four core principles: privacy and data protection, fairness and non-discrimination, transparency and explainability, and societal impact. Furthermore, to illustrate a practical application of our guidelines, we apply them to a recent AA study that targets identifying and linking potential human trafficking vendors. We believe the proposed guidelines can assist researchers and practitioners in justifying their decisions, assisting ethical committees in promoting responsible practices, and identifying ethical concerns related to NLP-based AA approaches. Our study aims to contribute to ensuring the responsible development and deployment of AA tools.}

	abstract     = {This paper presents a longitudinal study of more than ten years of activity on Instagram consisting of over a million posts by 400 content creators from four countries: the US, Brazil, Netherlands and Germany. Our study shows differences in the professionalisation of content monetisation between countries, yet consistent patterns; significant differences in the frequency of posts yet similar user engagement trends; and significant differences in the disclosure of sponsored content in some countries, with a direct connection with national legislation. We analyse shifts in marketing strategies due to legislative and platform feature changes, focusing on how content creators adapt disclosure methods to different legal environments. We also analyse the impact of disclosures and sponsored posts on engagement and conclude that, although sponsored posts have lower engagement on average, properly disclosing ads does not reduce engagement further. Our observations stress the importance of disclosure compliance and can guide authorities in developing and monitoring them more effectively.}

	abstract     = {Simultaneous machine translation aims at solving the task of real-time translation by starting to translate before consuming the full input, which poses challenges in terms of balancing quality and latency of the translation. The wait-k policy offers a solution by starting to translate after consuming words, where the choice of the number k directly affects the latency and quality. In applications where we seek to keep the choice over latency and quality at inference, the wait-k policy obliges us to train more than one model. In this paper, we address the challenge of building one model that can fulfil multiple latency levels and we achieve this by introducing lightweight adapter modules into the decoder. The adapters are trained to be specialized for different wait-k values and compared to other techniques they offer more flexibility to allow for reaping the benefits of parameter sharing and minimizing interference. Additionally, we show that by combining with an adaptive strategy, we can further improve the results. Experiments on two language directions show that our method outperforms or competes with other strong baselines on most latency values.}

Using an enhanced LegalLens dataset covering labor, privacy, and consumer protection domains, 38 teams participated in the task. Our analysis reveals that while a mix of approaches was used, the top-performing teams in both tasks consistently relied on fine-tuning pre-trained language models, outperforming legal-specific models and few-shot methods. The top-performing team achieved a 7.11{\%} improvement in NER over the baseline, while NLI saw a more marginal improvement of 5.7{\%}. Despite these gains, the complexity of legal texts leaves room for further advancements.}
